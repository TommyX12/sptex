? get ideas from doc

make possible to import preprocessors from preset using python import statements.

get useful util stuff from docstring generator
    
SP SC shortcut-processed latex
    better fraction detection that uses brackets, and remove those brackets automatically
    
SP eval python expr
SP DEF define python function that is usable in exec and SP
SP CLASS define python class
SP EX executes python code
SP SAVE save into a var
SP FOR or something that does printf-like stuff
common ones like list, enum, item, section, title, figures, table, equation, 
auto cap, auto correct, auto line break
noindent for all
all the equ stuff from 240
convert python dict, 2d array, csv etc into table

a better keyword like @ or $ or # instead of SP

? search up the use of \hline

a bunch of functions used for inline string processing, such as some math stuff

more informative syntax error notice, instead of crashing compiler
    add checks and mechanisms to allow exception abort
    
a global dictionary for use

auto scan for additional config file present and import module from it, or including headers like cpp.
also have a command INIT that put some init stuff needed such as listset for a document

optimization: better compilation algorithm (ex. less '' + '')
minor improvements such as make sure EX return don't have a final \n

? search up existing ??? to latex compiler / preprocessor.

tutorial for the use of:
    var, global_data (can and should store style etc)
    ans
    put / put_line
    chaining SP (ex. SP EQU SP SC)
    writing own preprocessors
    directly calling such as SP_UPPER().run(['hello']) in SP EX
    rules for equation auto line break and auto align (skip the ones within brackets, and skip the ones that already have it)

? issues:
    you can't reference a function added with add_env in another function added with add_env.
    
    messing with global and doing multiple compilation at the same time might create bad things
